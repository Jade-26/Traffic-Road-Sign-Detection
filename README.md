# Traffic-Road-Sign-Detection
A Convolutional Neural Net which classifies an input traffic scenario into 4 classes - 
{Traffic Lights, Stop Sign, Pedestrian Sign, Speed Limit signs}

The dataset used in this project is sourced from {https://makeml.app/datasets/road-signs}, which is then converted to a suitable format to be used by our model.

## Instructions to Execute the Model
Create a `dataset` folder in your local repositories and its contents as 4 directories - `Pedestrian`, `Speedlimit`, `Stop`, `Traffic_Light`  
Once this is done you can evaluate the script corresponding to this dataset conversion in the model.pynb

The dataset in the suitable format already exists in the `dataset` folder in this repository, so you can move forwards executing the respective code blocks
